This embeds V8 in a module, so you can validate javascript files in Ruby.

Basic Example:

require 'V8/V8'

puts V8.compile('some_javascript.js')


This will return either false (for no errors) or an array of errors.
Demo usage is in test.rb

You may have to compile V8 yourself and replace the libv8.a file.
